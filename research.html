      <h2>Ongoing & Past Work</h2>

      <h3>🧠 Neuroimaging Deep Learning – Massachusetts General Hospital</h3>
      <p>
        Worked on deep learning pipelines for analyzing neuroimaging datasets.  
        Explored model architectures for robust image analysis and clinical research applications.
      </p>

      <h3>🪞 Embodiment & Avatar Perception Research</h3>
      <p>
        Preparing a conference presentation on:
        <em>"Avatars, Should We Look at Them Directly or through a Mirror?"</em>  
        Focused on avatar display modalities and their effects on sense of embodiment.
      </p>

      <h3>🔍 Medical Image Segmentation Research</h3>
      <p>
        Developing and evaluating U-Net-based architectures for tumor and cell segmentation,
        with emphasis on generalization, efficiency, and clinical applicability.
      </p>
